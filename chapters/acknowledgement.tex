\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, my gratitude goes out to Alexandre Gramfort: my advisor, mentor and friend. Throughout these years, Alexandre has inspired me with his technical knowledge, his vision for long term impact, philosophy of open science, and wisdom. He introduced me to the welcoming MNE-Python community which ultimately formed by collaboration network: Denis Engemann, Teon Brooks, Eric Larson, Chris Holdgraf, Jona Sassenhagen, and Jean-RÃ©mi King, to name a few. It is these interactions that often led to new research projects and ideas. To my co-authors: Denis, Jaakko, Fede, Tom, and Umut, I thank them for bearing with my whims. I thank my collaborators and friends at Neurospin for inviting me to their social events and challenging me with new decoding problems. \\
