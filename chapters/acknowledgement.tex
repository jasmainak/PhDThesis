\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, my gratitude goes out to Alexandre Gramfort: my advisor, mentor and friend. Through these years, Alex has inspired me with his technical knowledge, his vision for long term impact, philosophy of open science, and wisdom. He introduced me to the welcoming and progressive MNE community which ultimately formed my collaboration network. It is these interactions that often led to new research projects and ideas. I thank Denis Engemann, a core contributor to MNE, who played a particularly pivotal role during these years as he shared his knowledge on the subtleties of MEG signal analysis and motivated me through our mini coding sprints. I thank Teon Brooks for collaborating with me on the BIDS project, Eric Larson for sharing his extensive open source experience, and other MNE team members. I thank Pavan Ramkumar for being my longtime collaborator and friend, and for introducing me to the world of machine learning in neuroscience. I thank Robert for his optimization course with Alex.

To my co-authors, I thank them for bearing with my whims and fancies. None of my projects would have been possible without the teamwork and efforts put in by them. I thank Umut for his time and expertise in Bayesian methods and signal processing. Jaakko's presence in the lab as an MNE engineer meant I spent less effort hunting bugs in MNE and more time on my thesis research. Yousra has been not just a co-author but a friend, counsel, and the ``Einstein" when I was stuck with a particularly tricky bug. I thank Tom, whose implementation skills were crucial in our projects. 

I thank my office mates for sharing the seminars, the Monday cakes, and the latest free food event. I thank my collaborators and friends at the Neurospin laboratory for inviting me to their social events and challenging me with new decoding problems. It is here that I made many like-minded international friends. To my French teacher Fran√ßoise and our Tuesday French lunch group, I am immensely indebted. I thank my international friends: Gabriela, Magdalena, Fosca, David and Sokhany. I thank my neighbors, my climbing partners, hiking group, and the \textit{desi} Indian community in France for making me feel home: Aakanksha, Anshuman, Chirag, Nilesh, Niraj, Pratheeban, Praveer, Raghav and Shabbir, Sidharth, and Vamsi.

I thank my sister for her sense of humor and adventure. Finally, I thank my parents for their unconditional love.
