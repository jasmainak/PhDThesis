\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, my gratitude goes out to Alexandre Gramfort: my advisor, mentor and friend. Throughout these years, Alexandre has inspired me with his technical knowledge, his vision for long term impact, philosophy of open science, and wisdom. He introduced me to the welcoming and progressive MNE community which ultimately formed my collaboration network. It is these interactions that often led to new research projects and ideas. I thank Denis Engemann, a core contributor to MNE, who played a particularly pivotal role during these years as he shared his knowledge on the subtleties of MEG signal analysis and motivated me through our mini coding sprints. I thank Teon Brooks for collaborating with me on the BIDS project, Eric Larson for sharing his extensive open source experience, and other MNE team members: Jona Sassenhagen, Jean-Rémi King to name a few. I thank Pavan Ramkumar for being my longtime collaborator and friend, and for introducing me to the world of machine learning in neuroscience.

To my co-authors, I thank them for bearing with my whims and fancies. None of my projects would have been possible without the teamwork and efforts put in by them. I thank Umut for giving his time to answer my silly questions and work through the math with me. His experience in audio signal processing and probabilistic methods for machine learning has broadened my horizons. Jaakko's presence in the lab as an MNE engineer meant I spent less effort hunting bugs in MNE and more time on my thesis research (and playing tennis). Yousra has been not just a co-author but a friend, counsel, and the ``Einstein" when I was stuck with a particularly tricky bug. I thank Tom, whose expertise in scikit-learn and implementation skills were crucial during our projects. 

I thank my office mates for sharing the seminars, the Monday cakes, and the latest free food event. I thank my collaborators and friends at the Neurospin laboratory for inviting me to their social events and challenging me with new decoding problems. It is here that I made many like-minded international friends. To my French teacher Françoise and our Tuesday French lunch group, I am immensely indebted. It made life in France much easier for me. I could not have been productive without a vibrant social life which was made possible due to my friends. I thank Gabriela for the \textit{vernissage} events, Fosca for the bouldering evenings, David for organizing our weekly hiking trips, and Sokhany for making me see cooking in a new light. I thank my neighbors Anshuman and Bianca for the movie nights. I thank the \textit{desi} Indian community in France for making me feel home: Aakanksha for her amazing Indian cooking, Praveer for his jokes, Shabbir for his poetry, Pratheeban, Neeraj, Chirag, Sidharth, and Raghav. I did not realize how days in Paris flew by taking the metro to Gare du Nord with Raghav to grab the spiciest meal in town.

I thank my sister for her sense of humor and adventure. Finally, I thank my parents for their unconditional love.
