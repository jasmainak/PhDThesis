\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, my gratitude goes out to Alexandre Gramfort: my advisor, mentor and friend. Throughout these years, Alexandre has inspired me with his technical knowledge, his vision for long term impact, philosophy of open science, and wisdom. He introduced me to the welcoming MNE-Python community which ultimately formed by collaboration network: Denis Engemann, Teon Brooks, Eric Larson, Chris Holdgraf, Jona Sassenhagen, and Jean-Rémi King, to name a few. It is these interactions that often led to new research projects and ideas. To my co-authors: Denis, Jaakko, Tom, and Umut, I thank them for bearing with my whims. None of my projects would have been possible with the teamwork and efforts put in by the co-authors. I thank my office mates for sharing the seminars, the Monday cakes, and the latest free food event. Yousra here deserves a special mention for having been a friend, counsel, and the ``Einstein" when I was stuck with a particularly tricky bug.

I thank my collaborators and friends at the Neurospin laboratory for inviting me to their social events and challenging me with new decoding problems. It is here that I made many like-minded international friends. To my French teacher Françoise and our Tuesday French lunch group, I am immensely indebted. It made life in France much easier for me. To the many friends I made socially inside and outside of work, I thank them for enduring my jokes. I thank Jaakko for introducing me to tennis, Gabriela for the \textit{vernissage} events, Fosca for being my bouldering partner, David for organizing our weekly hiking trips, and Sokhany for making me see cooking in a new light. I thank the \textit{desi} Indian community in France for offering a home away from home: Aakanksha, Praveer, Pratheeban, Shabbir, and Raghav.

I thank my sister for her sense of humor and my parents for their unconditional love.
