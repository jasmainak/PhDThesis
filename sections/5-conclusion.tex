\section{Conclusion \& future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented an algorithm to automatically reject and repair bad trials/sensors based on their peak-to-peak amplitude which is so far done manually in standard preprocessing pipelines. The algorithm was tested on three publicly available datasets and compared to a competitive benchmark. Finally, the code will be made publicly available.
